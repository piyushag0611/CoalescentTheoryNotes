# About

I am excited to note down my understanding from *Coalescent Theory: An Introduction* by *John Wakeley*. The book was recommended by my supervisor and was meant to be the first step in my thesis. Sadly, ignorantly I am still not there by the end of my first year. I did read stretches from the book, but did not make it cover to cover. I intend to wash away that mark and get a crucial first step to my thesis done. 

### Motivation {-}

There are a few fold objectives why I want to get some comprehensive set of notes written on the book:

1. It is to cement my own understanding. I know it is not enough to just read and have a claim of understanding. With no exercises, it is difficult to really make sure that I understand the content. I think that by **writing** down important pointers, I can make such a claim.

2. It will be a good written document for future purposes. I can advertise it for my own skills in the coalescent framework and refer to it in the future, given that there is no epdf of the book, and a library copy was difficult to retrieve.

3. Possibly helpful to my group. 

### Content {-}

The way I am joting down points are in the following way:

1. For metrics, distributions I am aiming to write down code, use sequences from NCBI or any other source and demonstrate the principals in the book. 

2. Mathematical expressions, equations will be derived from scratch. People not interested in derivations can simply skip them.

3. I will try to get a good sense of the purely theoretical ideas and make a decent case out of those ideas.
