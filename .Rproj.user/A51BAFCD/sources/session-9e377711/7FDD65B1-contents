# Gene Genealogies

John Wakeley first talks about the coalescent framework and population genetics in general, and its development over the past century.

1.  Population Genetics aims to understand the **forces** that produce and maintain **genetic variation** among species:
    a.  Mutation
    b.  Recombination
    c.  Natural Selection
    d.  Population Structure
    e.  Random transmission of genetic material

<br>

2.  Coalescent Theory is a part of population genetics formulated to provide a mathematical framework for the analysis of *DNA sequence data*. So given a bunch of DNA sequences, the goal is to understand the population level processes that result in the variation observed in the sequences.

<br>

3.  Coalescent Theory deals with ancestry of the given sample of sequences and hence is a retrospective analysis (*backward in time*) of the variation than the classical prospective (*forward in time*) view of population genetics.

<br>

4.  The focus is on DNA sequences sampled from the **same genetic locus** and coming from a **single species** rather than a bunch of different species. The claim is that such a sample makes any study of the random effects of birth and death and other process within that population possible.

<br>

5.  (Remark from me) We assume that we are provided with a sample of well-assembled and aligned sequences, which is a very difficult task on its own.

## Genealogies and Genealogical Thinking

Genealogy is the set of *ancestral* relationship among the members of a sample.

<br>

For the first chapters we assume that sequences are extracted from regions without any recombination. With this assumption and another assumption that all life starts from a single common ancestor, the genealogy of any sample can be represented as a *rooted bifurcating tree*. Rooted because any sample has to share a common ancestor back in time (courtesy of the second assumption) and bifurcation because DNA replicates to give two copies. (*It is an interesting question in itself though, Are we really sure that DNA replicates into just exactly two copies or perhaps there was a time when it could have replicated into more copies?*)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Gene Genealogy with 5 samples: Bifurcated Tree with root not shown', fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
source("plot_ms_trees_single_pop.R")
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1))
plot_ms_tree(5, "-T -G 0.1")
```

5 Sequences {*s1, s2, s3, s4, s5*} are drawn at the current time $t=0$ and going back in time, pairs of lineages merge together. The internal nodes denote the common ancestors of the pair of lineages merging into it. Starting with $n$ samples, ($n=5$ in the above figure), there are $n-1$ internal nodes and a total of $2n-2$ branches with $n$ external branches *connecting the tips to the internal nodes* and $n-2$ internal branches connecting the internal nodes.

### An unnumbered section {.unnumbered}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
