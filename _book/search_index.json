The book was recommended by my supervisor and was meant to be the first step in my thesis. Sadly, ignorantly I am still not there by the end of my first year. I did read stretches from the book, but did not make it cover to cover. I intend to wash away that mark and get a crucial first step to my thesis done. 1.1 Motivation There are a few fold objectives why I want to get some comprehensive set of notes written on the book: It is to cement my own understanding. I know it is not enough to just read and have a claim of understanding. With no exercises, it is difficult to really make sure that I understand the content. I think that by writing down important pointers, I can make such a claim. It will be a good written document for future purposes. I can advertise it for my own skills in the coalescent framework and refer to it in the future, given that there is no epdf of the book, and a library copy was difficult to retrieve. Possibly helpful to my group. 1.2 Content The way I am joting down points are in the following way: For metrics, distributions I am aiming to write down code, use sequences from NCBI or any other source and demonstrate the principals in the book. Mathematical expressions, equations will be derived from scratch. People not interested in derivations can simply skip them. I will try to get a good sense of the purely theoretical ideas and make a decent case out of those ideas. "],["gene-genealogies.html", "Chapter 2 Gene Genealogies 2.1 Genealogies and Genealogical Thinking", " Chapter 2 Gene Genealogies John Wakeley first talks about the coalescent framework and population genetics in general, and its development over the past century. Population Genetics aims to understand the forces that produce and maintain genetic variation among species: Mutation Recombination Natural Selection Population Structure Random transmission of genetic material Coalescent Theory is a part of population genetics formulated to provide a mathematical framework for the analysis of DNA sequence data. So given a bunch of DNA sequences, the goal is to understand the population level processes that result in the variation observed in the sequences. Coalescent Theory deals with ancestry of the given sample of sequences and hence is a retrospective analysis (backward in time) of the variation than the classical prospective (forward in time) view of population genetics. The focus is on DNA sequences sampled from the same genetic locus and coming from a single species rather than a bunch of different species. The claim is that such a sample makes any study of the random effects of birth and death and other process within that population possible. (Remark from me) We assume that we are provided with a sample of well-assembled and aligned sequences, which is a very difficult task on its own. 2.1 Genealogies and Genealogical Thinking Genealogy is the set of ancestral relationship among the members of a sample. For the first chapters we assume that sequences are extracted from regions without any recombination. With this assumption and another assumption that all life starts from a single common ancestor, the genealogy of any sample can be represented as a rooted bifurcating tree. Rooted because any sample has to share a common ancestor back in time (courtesy of the second assumption) and bifurcation because DNA replicates to give two copies. (It is an interesting question in itself though, Are we really sure that DNA replicates into just exactly two copies or perhaps there was a time when it could have replicated into more copies?) Figure 2.1: Gene Genealogy with 5 samples: Bifurcated Tree with root not shown 5 Sequences {s1, s2, s3, s4, s5} are drawn at the current time \\(t=0\\) and going back in time, pairs of lineages merge together. The internal nodes denote the common ancestors of the pair of lineages merging into it. Starting with \\(n\\) samples, (\\(n=5\\) in the above figure), there are \\(n-1\\) internal nodes and a total of \\(2n-2\\) branches with \\(n\\) external branches connecting the tips to the internal nodes and \\(n-2\\) internal branches connecting the internal nodes. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["the-coalescent.html", "Chapter 3 The Coalescent 3.1 Basic Population Genetic Models 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 The Coalescent After introducing and defining genealogies in the previous chapter, John Wakeley talks about the statistical properties of genealogies under the coalescent framework. To demonstrate the coalescent framework, he uses the classical population genetics models: a. Wright Fisher Model b. Moran Model and shows these models converging to the Coalescent in the limit. Throughout this chapter, there is no reference to variation in sequences with the following two reasons: 1. A sample without any variation still supports a genealogy, because of the way DNA replication takes place. 2. All variation is assumed to be selectively neutral (any selection is dealt later in the book) and so there is no population advantage with respect to any particular variation. 3.1 Basic Population Genetic Models Wright Fisher Model Perfectly non-overlapping generations Population size is constant and finite at all times Each generation all current individuals die and are replaced by their offsprings. This is a random process with the possibility that a current individual has no offsprings in the next generation. For any individual in the next generation, any individual in the current generation has an equal chance of being a parent. Let’s consider a simple example of a population with two alleles A and B following the WF model. Let the population size be \\(N\\) and \\(K_t\\) be the no. of A alleles in generation \\(t\\) with \\(K_0 = i\\). Then the probability that the \\(K_1 = j\\) is given by: \\[\\mathbb{P}_{ij} = {N \\choose j}\\left(\\frac{i}{N}\\right)^j\\left(1-\\frac{i}{N}\\right)^{N-j}\\] We also have that the expected number and variance of A alleles in generation \\(1\\) as \\[\\begin{align*} &amp; \\mathbb{E}(K_1) = N\\left(\\frac{i}{N}\\right) = i \\\\ &amp; \\mathbb{V}ar(K_1) = N \\left(\\frac{i}{N}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{i}{N}\\right) = i\\left(1-\\frac{i}{N}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] The expected number of A alleles remains unchanged over time. Moran Model There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here]. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.
